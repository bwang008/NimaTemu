I want to create a process that will take the input file in the data/price folder called 'PRICES.XLS' 

On row 6 of 'Sheet1', reference column A's column name, 'Item #' to get the product SKU. 

For column Z, 'On-hand Qty' to get the product stock/inventory

For column AC, 'Sale Price' to get the product price.

Using this file as a source of truth and the product SKU as a matching key, update the product price and inventory.

I would like this process to be called while Faire2Temu.py is being run, so when you take a SKU from the faire_products.xlsx file, in addition to moving it to the temu_template.xlsx file, I want the SKU to also be written to a copy of 2 files in the data folder called 'temu_price_template.xlsx' for the price data, and 'temu_stock_template'xlsx' for the inventory data.

In 'temu_price_template.xlsx':

Row 1 contains the column names.

In the 'SKU ID' column A, place the SKU value from the faire_products.xlsx file
In the 'Current base price' column B, place the 'Base Price - USD' column value
in the 'New base price' column C, place the 'Sale Price' value from the 'PRICES.XLS' file with the matching SKU value (So column A in the temu_price_template.xlsx file and the 'Item #' column in the 'PRICES.XLS' should match to pull the record, otherwise if no record is found leave it as a copy of 'Base Price - USD' 

Save this copy as 'temu_price_update.xsx' in the output folder.

In 'temu_stock_template.xlsx':

In the 'SKU' place the SKU from the faire_products.xlsx file 
Leave 'SKU ID' blank
in '*New quantity' or column C, put the inventory from the matching SKU in 'PRICES.XLS' 
If there is no matching SKU, then put the value as 0.

Save the copy as 'temu_stock_update.xlsx' in the output folder.
